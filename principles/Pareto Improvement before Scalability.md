Or: Be better than any job.
Or: First aim to beat your old life on all dimensions.

The first goal any company should aim to achieve for its founders is "Be better than any job."

The currency in which you measure "better" can be money plus any non-financial values you choose.

This principle implies that your first goal in starting a company should be to find your favorite people, and then by using their individual quirks, personalities, and skills, to get *at least* enough revenue to support yourself and them without hating your life or wishing you had a normal job.

Before you worry about scaling or products or anything else, first aim to beat your old life on all dimensions.

Find your favorite people, and build a life that beats any job.
