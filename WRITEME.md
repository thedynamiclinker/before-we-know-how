Hi there,

This book is for employees, workers, people who hate their jobs, or anyone whose job is just ok but often dreams of something better.

There's never been a worse time to be an employee. There's never been a better time to start a business.

This book is a guide for the disillusioned on how to quit work, and start working for yourself.

Before you know how.
