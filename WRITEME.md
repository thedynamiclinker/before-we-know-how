<span style="display: block; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">The Book of Laws</span>

Hi there,

This book is for employees, workers, people who hate their jobs, or anyone who think their job is just ok but dreams of something better.

There's never been a worse time to be an employee. There's never been a better time to start a business.

The AI apocalypse may come for your current company or career, but it doesn't have to be a dystopia we should fear.

This book is a guide for the disillusioned on how to quit work, and start working for yourself. Not later. Now.

Before you know how.
